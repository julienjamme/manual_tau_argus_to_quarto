## The apriori file
The apriori file can be used to modify the characteristics of a cellbefore the secondary cell suppression routines are called. You canmodify the following characteristics:

-   Cell status

-   Cost-function

-   Protection levels
The apriori file is a simple text-file that can be created withnotepad and similar programs. The layout of the apriori file issimple. First the codes of the spanning variables are given, separatedby a semicolon (";"), then the code indicating the change requestedand the depending on the code some additional parameters

Note: changing the status of a cell is of course limited. E.g. aprimary unsafe cell cannot become protected, nor can a protected cellbecome unsafe.
The cost function must always be positive.
It is recommended to restrict the use of setting a cell status toprotected. If you want to prevent that a cell will become a secondarysuppression, give it a high cost value. If this cell is neverthelesssuppressed, there will be a good reason for this. Putting a cell toprotected, might lead to infeasible problems with all the consequencesof that.
An example:
Nr, 4, u
Zd, 6, p
5, 5, c, 1

The apriori file allows you to feed τ-argus a list of cells where thestatus of the standard rules can be overruled. E.g. a cell must bekept confidential or not for other reasons that just because of thesensitivity rules. By modifying the cost-function you can influencethe selection of the secondaries. E.g. the cells suppressed last yearcan get a preference for the suppression this year by giving this cella small value for the cost-function.
The option 'trivial levels' is important. Often in a table withhierarchies, some levels in a hierarchy break down in only one lowerlevel. This implies that there are different cells in a table whichare implicitly the same. Changing the status of one of them might leadto inconsistencies and serious problems. E.g. one of the two is unsafeand the other is protected, the solution is impossible. If you selectthe option 'Expand for trivial levels', τ‑argus will always modify allcells that are the same if you modify one of them.
