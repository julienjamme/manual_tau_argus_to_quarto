## Preparation

-   *First steps*. Before using τ‑argus for the first time, some options
    > should be set to make τ‑argus better usable in your environment.
    > E.g. you can select the solver you want to use in secondary cell
    > suppression. See section [3.1.1]

-   *Open Microdata*. This involves selecting both the microdata and the
    > associated metadata. See section [3.1.2]

-   *Specify Metafile*. This shows how the metafile can be entered when
    > there in no metafile available, or can be edited after being read
    > in but before any tables are being specified. This includes
    > options such as declaring variables to be explanatory or response,
    > and setting up the hierarchical structure of the data and the
    > location of the variables in the file. See section
    > [3.1.3]

-   *Specify Tables*. Declare the tables for which protection is
    > required, along with the safety rule and minimum frequency rule on
    > which the primary suppressions will be based. When this has been
    > finished the tables will be computed or read in. See section
    > [3.1.4]

-   *Process of Disclosure Control*. The main window of τ‑argus will
    > show the table that we have computed or read in and when all the
    > safety rules for primary suppressions have been applied.

-   You can inspect the table; get information about the number of
    > unsafe cells etc. It contains options to modify the table using
    > global recoding. There are several options to make the table safe
    > via secondary cell suppression and rounding. Also an audit
    > procedure is available to check quality of any secondary
    > suppression pattern. See section [3.2]

-   *Save Table*. The user can save the 'safe' table in a number of
    > formats as will be seen in section [3.3].

### First steps
Via (Help\|Options) you can open the options window.
Before starting the process of protecting a table, you can customise$\tau$-Argus. Some methods for secondary suppression (the modular and theoptimal), but also the audit procedure require an external linearprogramming solver. For the complex problems of $\tau$-Argus we haveconcluded that the use of high quality commercial solvers can beefficient. However also a free solver can be chosen as a goodalternative. Although $\tau$-Argus is freeware software these solvers arecommercial packages and you have to acquire a licence for themseparately. More information can be found on the casc-website([*https://research.cbs.nl/casc/*](https://research.cbs.nl/casc/)) Thechoice of this solver must be made before protecting a table. Thechoices are either Xpress or cplex or the free solver soplex, thedifferent LP_solvers supported by $\tau$-Argus. See also section[2.9] for more details.
![](Media/Pictures/10000000000001E600000138BEEDE4BF.png){width=13.229cm height=8.414cm}For cplex the name of the licence file mustspecified.
Once this window has been opened details of the solver can be entered.Also the maximum time the solver is allowed to spend on each sub-tablein Modular can be specified. However always a feasible solution issought.
And the name of the logbook, by default taulogbook.txt in thetemp-directory can be chosen.

### Open a microdata file
In this tour we only deal with how to open a fixed format microdatafile (see sections [3.1.2] to [3.1.4]). If analready constructed table is to be used, then go to the Referencechapter (section [4.3.2]). To start disclosure controlwith $\tau$-Argus there are three possible options:

1.  Open a ascii microdata file from which a table can be constructed,

2.  Open an already completed table,

3.  Open a SPSS systemfile containing the microdata
Opening an already completed table is not part of this tour. Seesection [4.3.2], Also the SPSS-option (see section[4.3.1]) is not part of this tour,
Both a microdata file and the metadata file describing this microdatafile are required. The microdata file must be either a fixed formatascii file or a free format file with a specified separator. Byclicking (File\|Open Microdata) you can specify both the name of themicrodata file and the name of the file containing the metadata.
![](Media/Pictures/1000000000000240000000DC95A72CE6.png){width=13cm height=5.089cm}
$\tau$-Argus, expects the microdata and metadata file to be stored inseparate files. The simplest way to use the program is to use theextension .ASC for the (fixed format) datafile and .RDA (RecordDescription for Argus) for the metadata file. If the name of themetadata file is the same as the datafile, except for the extension,and it already exists in the same directory, $\tau$-Argus will fill in thename of this metadata file automatically in the second textbox. If nometadata file is specified, the program has the facility to specifythe metadata interactively via the menu option (Specify\|Metafile).This is also the place to make changes to the metadata file. Insubsection [3.1.3] we will give a description of themetadata file for $\tau$-Argus.

### Specify metafile
When you enter or change the metadata file interactively using $\tau$-Argusthe option (Specify\|Metafile) will bring you to the following screen:
![](Media/Pictures/1000000000000381000002374DCB2899.png){width=13cm height=8.236cm}
The key elements of this window are the definitions for each variable.Most variables will be defined as one of the following.

-   Explanatory Variable: a variable to be used as a categorical
    > (spanning) variable when defining a table.

-   Response Variable: a numerical variable to be used as a cell item in
    > a table.

-   Weight variable: a variable containing the sampling weighting
    > scheme.
More details on these variables along with the others options can befound in the Reference chapter (subsection [4.4.1]).
Other important features of this window are as follows.

-   Codelist: $\tau$-Argus will always automatically build the codelists for
    > the explanatory variables from the datafile. However you can
    > enhance the presentation of the information if you can specify a
    > codelist file (a list-of-codes of the explanatory variables) as
    > follows.

    -   Automatic: The codelist is created from the categories in the
        > variable.

    -   Codelist file: The codes can be read in from an external file.
        > Each category can contain a label. The codelist is only used
        > for enhancing the presentation but always $\tau$-Argus will build a
        > codelist from the datafile itself.

-   Missing values: this gives information on the missing values which
    > are attached to a codelist. Two distinct missing value indicators
    > can be set (the reason for this is for the purposes of indicating
    > different reasons for missing values: for example perhaps
    > non-responses of different forms: maybe one code for the response
    > '*don\'t know',* and another for '*refusal'*). Missing values
    > however are not required.

-   Hierarchical codes: The hierarchy can be derived from

    -   the digits of the individual codes in the data file or

    -   a specified file containing the hierarchical structure. See
        > section [5.2]
Examples are shown in the metafile information below.
The Metafile
The metafile describes the variables in the microdata file, both therecord layout and some additional information necessary to perform theSDC-process. Each variable is specified on one main line, followed byone or more option lines. The options ine always start with an optionname enclosed in \"\<\" and \"\>\".An example is shown here. Theleading spaces shown only serve only to make the file more readable;they have no other meaning.

Details of the variables
*'Year'* : For this variable begins on position 1 of each record , is2 characters long and missing values are represented by 99. It is alsorecodeable implicitly stating that it is an explanatory or spanningvariable used to create the tables.
*'IndustryCode'*: For this variable begins on position 4 of eachrecord and is 5 characters long. Missing values are represented by99999. As well as being recodeable this variable is hierarchical andthe hierarchy structure is specified. The first 3 characters are inthe top hierarchy level, the 4^th^ character in the second level andthe 5^th^ character in the lowest level.
*'Size'*: For this variable begins on position 9 of each record and is2 characters long, and missing values are represented by 99. It isalso recodeable.
*'Region'*: For this variable begins on position 12 of each record andis 2 characters long. There is no missing value. There is a codelistfile *region.cdl* and of a hierarchical codelist file *region2.hrc*.Examples of these files are shown here.
*Note:* the codelist file is not essential; the content is only usedto enhance some information on the screen. The hierarchicalinformation however plays an essential role as it describes thestructure of the table and the relation between the cells.
*Note:* In both files the code for Total is not specified. $\tau$-Argusalways explicitly assumes that there will be a total in each dimensionof the table. Without totals there are no additivity constrains andhence there is no problem of Secondary Cell Suppression.

### Specify tables
When the metadata file is ready, the tables to be protected can bespecified. This is achieved via Specify\|Tables. A window to specifythe tables is presented. In the example here we have a 2 dimensionaltable (2 explanatory variables; Size x Region) and a response variable(Var2). A safety rule (p%-rule) has been defined.
![](Media/Pictures/10000000000002EC000002CD5753E43A.png){width=13cm height=12.42cm}
The key elements of this window are as follows.
Explanatory variables
On the left is the listbox with the explanatory variables.
Click on '\>\>' moves the selected variables to the next box in whichthe selected explanatory variables can be seen. From the box on theleft hand side, containing explanatory variables, the variables thatwill be used in the row or the column of the table, in a 2-way tablecan be selected. Up to six explanatory variables can be selected tocreate a table, but higher dimensions will restrict the options toprocess a table.
**Cell items**
The 'cell items' box contains the variables, which were declared as'response variables' in the metafile. By using the '\>\>' button theycan be moved to the 'response variable' box to be used in the definedtable.
**Response variable**
Any variable in the cell items box can be chosen as the responsevariable. Also the implicit variable \<freq\> for making a frequencytable.
Shadow variable
The shadow variable is the variable which is used to apply the safetyrule. By default this is the response variable. More details on theShadow variable can be found in section [4.4.4] in theReference chapter.
**Cost variable**
This variable describes the cost of each cell. These are the coststhat are minimised when the pattern of secondary suppressed cells arecalculated (see section [2.6] in the Theory chapter forthe further details). By default this is the response variable butother choices are possible. If the response or any other explicitlyspecified variable is used for this purpose, the radio button\'variable\' should be selected. Then, any variable name can betransferred from the cell items to the cost variable window. Howeverif the name is empty by default the response variable will be chosen.It is also possible to use the frequency of the cells as acost-function. This will suppress cells minimising the number ofcontributors to each cell. A third option is that the number of cellsto be suppressed is minimised, irrespective of the size of theircontributions (unity option -- cost variable is set to 1 for eachcell). However this tends to the suppression of totals and marginals.Also a distance function is available. More details will be given inthe Reference Chapter along with an example (section[4.4.4]). Note that choice of the cost variable does nothave any impact when using the hypercube method for secondarysuppression.
**Weight**
If the data file has a sample weight, specified in the metadata file,the table can be computed taking this weight into account. In thiscase, the \'apply weights\' box should be ticked. More details will begiven in the Reference Chapter along with an example (section[4.4.4]).
The safety rule
The concept of safety rules is explained in section [2.2]in the chapter on Theory. In this window the left side of the windowallows the type of rule to be selected, this is usually either thedominance rule or p% rule, along with the necessary parameter values.Several rules together can be set for any particular table.
Additionally, the minimum number of contributors (threshold rule) canbe chosen. In the window this is referred to as the 'MinimumFrequency'
Now for the readability of this chapter, brief summaries are providedof the Dominance and p% rules.
Dominance rule
This is sometimes referred to as the (n,k) rule. The rule states thatif the sum of contributions of the largest n contributors to a cell ismore than k%, the cell is considered disclosive.
This is the traditional rule; however we recommend to use the p% ruleas a better alternative. The p%-rule focusses more on the individualcontributors to a cell.
p% rule
The p% rule says that if the value of a cell *x*~*1*~ can be estimatedto an accuracy of better than p% of the true value then it isdisclosive where *x*~*1*~ is the largest contributor to a cell.
This rule can be written as:
$${{\sum\limits_{\mathit{ii} = 3}^{c}x_{i}} \geq \frac{p}{100}}x_{1}$$for the cell to be non-disclosive where *c* is the total number ofcontributors to the cell and the intruder is a respondent in the cell.
It is important to know that when entering this rule in $\tau$-Argus thevalue of *n* refers to the number of intruders in coalition (who wishto group together to estimate the largest contributor). In general n =1.
A typical example would be that the sum of all reporting unitsexcluding the largest two must be at least 10% of the value of thelargest. Therefore, in $\tau$-Argus set p=10 and n =1 as there is just oneintruder in the coalition, respondent *x*~*2*~.
*Note:* we only consider the situation for the largest contributor, asthis is the worst case. If the largest is safe all contributors aresafe.
The choice of safety rule is specified by the user and the chosenparameters can then be entered. From these parameters symmetric safetyranges are computed automatically prior to the secondary suppressions.
For the minimum frequency rule, a safety range is calculated from theuser given range. This is usually a small positive value and isrequired to enable secondary suppression to be carried out.
A manual safety range is also required for cells that can be madeunsafe by intervention of the user.
Other options such as the 'Request Rule' or the 'Holding Rule' will belooked at in more detail in the Reference chapter (section[4.4.4]).
When everything has been filled in, click \'˅\' to transport all thespecified parameters describing the table to the 'listwindow' on thebottom. As many tables as you want may be specified, only limited bythe memory of the computer. If a table is to be modified press the'\^' button.
Creating the Table
Pressing the 'Compute tables' button will invoke $\tau$-Argus to actuallycompute the tables requested and the process to start disclosurecontrol may be invoked. $\tau$-Argus will come back showing the (first)table in a spreadsheet like view number of unsafe cells per variable,per dimension, as explained in the next section [3.2].
