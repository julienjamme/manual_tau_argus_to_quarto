## Introduction
The growing demands from researchers, policy makers and others formore and more detailed statistical information lead to a conflict.Statistical offices collect large amounts of data for statisticalpurposes. The respondents are only willing to provide the statisticaloffices with the required information if they can be certain thatthese statistical offices will treat their data with the utmost care.This implies that respondents\' confidentiality must be guaranteed.This imposes limitations on the amount of detail in the publications.Practice and research have generated insights into how to protecttables, but the problem is not yet definitively solved.
Before we go into more details of the basic ideas on which $\tau$-Argus isbased, we give a sketch of the general ideas. At first sight one mightfind it difficult to understand that information presented in tabularform presents a disclosure risk. After all, one might say that theinformation is presented only in aggregate form.
Safe tables are produced from unsafe ones by applying certain SDCmeasures to the tables. These SDC measures - as far as they areimplemented in $\tau$-Argus - are discussed in the present section. Somekey concepts such as sensitive cells, information loss and the likeare discussed as well.
