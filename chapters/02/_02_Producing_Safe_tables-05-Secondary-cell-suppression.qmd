## Secondary cell suppression
Once the sensitive cells in a table have been identified, possiblyfollowing table redesign it might be a good idea to suppress thesevalues. In case no constraints on the possible values in the cells ofa table exist this is easy: one simply removes the cell valuesconcerned and the problem is solved. In practice, however, thissituation hardly ever occurs. Instead one has constraints on thevalues in the cells due to the presence of marginals and lower boundsfor the cell values (typically 0). The problem then is to findadditional cells that should be suppressed in order to protect thesensitive cells. The additional cells should be chosen in such a waythat the interval of possible values for each sensitive cell value issufficiently large. What is "sufficiently large" can be specified bythe data protector in $\tau$-Argus by specifying the protection intervals.
In general the secondary cell suppression problem turns out to be ahard problem, provided the aim is to retain as much information in thetable as possible, which, of course, is a quite natural requirement.The optimisation problems that will then result are quite difficult tosolve and require expert knowledge in the area of combinatorialoptimisation.
