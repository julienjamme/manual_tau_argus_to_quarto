## Series of tables
In $\tau$-Argus it is possible to specify a series of tables that will beprotected one by one, and independently of each other. It is moreefficient to choose this option since $\tau$-Argus requires only a singlerun through the microdata in order to produce the tables. But also forthe user it is often more attractive to specify a series of tables andlet $\tau$-Argus protect them in a single session, rather than have severalindependent sessions.
