## Series of tables

In $\tau$-Argus it is possible to specify a series of tables that will be protected one by one, and independently of each other. It is more efficient to choose this option since $\tau$-Argus requires only a single run through the microdata in order to produce the tables. But also for the user it is often more attractive to specify a series of tables and let $\tau$-Argus protect them in a single session, rather than have several independent sessions.
