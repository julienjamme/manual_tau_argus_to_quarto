## The modular approach for linked tables {#sec-modularlinkedtables}

When tables are linked through simple linear constraints, cell suppressions must obviously be coordinated between tables. The most typical case is when tables share common cells (usually marginals),i.e., when they are linked through constraints saying literally that cell $X$ of table A is identical to cell $Y$ of table B.

Suppose a set of $N$ tables, $\{T_{1},\dots,T_{N}\}$, need to be protected. These tables are assumed to be linked. Each table has a hierarchical structure that may differ from the hierarchical structures of the other tables. However, it is assumed that tables using the same spanning variables have hierarchies that can becovered. Loosely speaking this means that a single hierarchy can be constructed such that all hierarchies of the same variable in the $N$ tables are a sub hierarchy of the cover hierarchy. See De Wolf and Giessing (2009) for more details. In the context of pre-planned table production processes which are typically in place in statistical agencies for the production of certain sets of pre-specified standard tabulations, it is normally no problem to satisfy these conditions. Literally speaking, the assumption is that tables in a set of linked tables may present the data in a breakdown by the same spanning variable at various amounts of detail. But only under the condition that, if in one of the tables some categories of a spanning variable are grouped into a certain intermediate sum category, during SDC processing this intermediate sum category is considered in any other table presenting the data in a breakdown of the same spanning variable and at that much detail.

The idea is then as follows. Suppose that the $N$ tables$\{T_{1},\dots,T_{N}\}$ that need to be protected simultaneously, contain $M$ different spanning variables. Since the hierarchies are supposed to be coverable, an $M$-dimensional table exists having all the specified tables as subtables. The spanning variables will benumbered 1 up to $M$.

Each spanning variable can have several hierarchies in the specified tables. Denote those hierarchies for spanning variable $i$ by $\mathcal{H}_{1}^{i},\dots,\mathcal{H}_{I_{i}}^{i}$ where $I_{i}$ is the number of different hierarchies of variable $i$.

Define the $M$-dimensional table by the table with spanning variables according to hierarchies $G_{1},\dots,G_{M}$  such that, for each $i = 1,\dots,M$  hierarchy $G_{i}$ covers the set of hierarchies $\{\mathcal{H}_{j}^{i}\}$ with $j = 1,\dots,I_{i}$. This $M$-dimensional table will be called the cover table. See De Wolf and Giessing (2009) for more details.

Then use the Modular approach (see @sec-modularapproach) on the cover table $T_{C}$, but only consider those subtables that are alsosubtables of at least one of the specified tables $T_{1},\dots,T_{N}$ and disregard the other subtables.
I.e., the procedure of the Modular approach is followed, but during that process any simple subtable that is not a subtable of any of thetables in the set $\{T_{1},\dots,T_{N}\}$  is skipped. I.e., the orderthe simple subtables will be protected, is the same as in the 'complete' Modular approach, only some subtables will be skipped.

See De Wolf and Hundepool (2010) for a practical application of the Adjusted Modular Approach.
