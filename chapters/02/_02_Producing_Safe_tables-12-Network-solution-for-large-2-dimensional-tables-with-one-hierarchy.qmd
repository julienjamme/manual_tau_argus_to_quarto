## Network solution for large 2 dimensional tables with one hierarchy
$\tau$-Argus also contains a solution for the secondary cell suppressionbased on network flows. This contribution is by Jordi Casto of theUniversitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. The network flowssolution for cell suppression implements a fast heuristic for theprotection of statistical data in two-dimensional tables with onehierarchical dimension (1H2D tables). This new heuristic sensiblycombines and improves ideas of previous approaches for the secondarycell suppression problem in two-dimensional general, see Castro(1994)and positive tables, see Kelly(1992) and Castro(2003) tables. Detailsabout the heuristic can be found in Castro(1996) and Cox(1995).Unfortunately this approach is only possible for two-dimensionaltables with only one hierarchy, due to the limitations of the networkflows. Note that the hierarchical variable should be the firstvariable.
The heuristic is based on the solution of a sequence of shortest-pathsubproblems that guarantee a feasible pattern of suppressions (i.e.,one that satisfies the protection levels of sensitive cells).Hopefully, this feasible pattern will be close to the optimal one.
The current package is linked with three solvers: CPLEX7.5/8.0 seeILOG(2000) pprn see Castro(1996), and an efficient implementation ofthe bidirectional Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest-paths (that willbe denoted as "Dijkstra") see Ahuja(1993). Later releases of cplexwill also work if the interface routines are the same than for version8.0. The heuristic can use any of the three solvers for the solutionof the shortest path subproblems, although Dijkstra is recommended(and the default one) for efficiency reasons. cplex is needed if alower bound of the optimal solution want to be computed. The auditingphase can be performed with either cplex or pprn.
pprn and Dijkstra were implemented at the Dept. of Statistics andOperations Research of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, andare included in NF CSP. pprn was originally developed during1992--1995, but it had to be significantly improved within the CASCproject to work with NF CSP. Dijkstra was completely developed in thescope of CASC. The third solver, cplex, is a commercial tool, andrequires purchasing a license. However, pprn is a fairly goodreplacement---although not so robust--- for the network flows routinesof cplex. Therefore, in principle, there is no need for an externalcommercial solver, unless lower bounds want to be computed.
Even though two of the three solvers are included in the distributionof NF CSP, this document only describes the features of the heuristic,and from the user's point of view. A detailed description of pprn andDijkstra's solvers can be found in Castro(1996) and Ahuja(1993),respectively.
The current implementation in $\tau$-Argus however only uses the Dijkstraand the pprn solvers. We have restricted ourselves from commercialsolvers here as the network flows give already a very fast solution.
