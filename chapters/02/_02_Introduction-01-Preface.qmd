## Preface
This is the user\'s manual for τ-argus version 4.1. τ-argus is asoftware tool designed to assist a data protector in producing safetables. This manual describes the first Open Source version ofτ-argus. After a long history of development at Statistics Netherlands(CBS) as closed software, CBS has decided to convert τ-argus towardsOpen Source. This process coincides with the formal retirement of themain developer, Anco Hundepool. With the financial support of Eurostatwe have been able to do this transformation and we hope that thefuture of τ-argus is secured. The main aim of this transition projectwas to port the current (version 3.5) of τ-argus to an openenvironment. So this version 4.1 does not contain many new extensions.The whole user-interface has been rewritten in java, replacing the oldVisual Basic version. The aim of this transition is to be in an openenvironment and also be platform independent. So also a unix versionis possible now.
Nevertheless with respect to the previous release of τ-argus we havemade a few steps forward, and τ-argus now has facilities to protecttables via Controlled Tabular Adjustment (CTA). These routines forthis have been developed by Jordi Castro of the Polytechnic Universityof Catalonia.
We have also added the option to use a free open solver (soplex) inaddition to the classical commercial solvers like cplex and Xpress.However we expect that these commercial solvers are still very muchneeded, when we want to protect large serious tables.
The purpose of τ-argus is to protect tables against the risk ofdisclosure, i.e. the accidental or deliberate disclosure ofinformation related to individuals from a statistical table. This isachieved by modifying the table so that it contains less detailedinformation. τ-argus allows for several modifications of a table: atable can be redesigned, meaning that rows and columns can becombined; sensitive cells can be suppressed and additional cells toprotect these can be found in some optimum way (secondary cellsuppression). Also rounding and CTA can be used to protect sensitivetables.
The purpose of the present manual is to give a potential user enoughinformation so that he can understand the general principles on whichτ-argus is based, and also allow him to use the package. So itcontains both general background information and detailed programinformation. For a more in-depth theoretical background we refer tothe handbook "[Statistical DisclosureControl](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119978157.html)"by Anco Hundepool, Josep Domingo-Ferrer, Luisa Franconi, SarahGiessing, Eric Schulte Nordholt, Keith Spicer and Peter-Paul de Wolf(ISBN: 978-1-119-97815-2, Wiley, 2012).
τ-argus is one of a twin set of disclosure control packages. For theprotection of microdata - μ-argus - has been developed, which is thetwin brother of τ-argus.^[^1]^ Also μ-argus has been ported to OpenSource.
