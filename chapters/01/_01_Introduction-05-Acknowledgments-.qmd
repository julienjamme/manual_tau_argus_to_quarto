$\tau$-Argus was started as part of the EU 4^th^ framework SDC-project andbecame a mature software tool as part of the CASC project that was partly sponsored by the EU under contract number IST-2000-25069. This support is highly appreciated. The CASC (Computational Aspects ofStatistical Confidentiality) project is part of the Fifth Framework ofthe European Union. The main part of $\tau$-Argus has been developed at Statistics Netherlands by Aad van de Wetering and Ramya Ramaswamy (who wrote the kernel) and Anco Hundepool (who wrote the interface). However this software would not have been possible without the contributions of several others, both partners in the CASC-project and outsiders. Recent extensions of $\tau$-Argus have been made possible during the European CENEX-SDC-project (grant agreement25200.2005.001-2005.619), the ESSNet-SDC project (grant agreement25200.2005.003-2007.670.) and the ESSnet SDC harmonisation (61102.2010.004-2010.579).
The Open Source transition was supported by a Eurostat grant (61102.2012.001-2012.102).

The German partners Statistisches Bundesamt (Sarah Giessing and Dietz Repsilber) have contributed the ghmiter software, which offers a solution for secondary cell suppression based on hypercubes.Peter-Paul de Wolf has built a search algorithm based on non-hierarchical optimal solutions. This algorithm breaks down a large hierarchical table into small non-hierarchical subtables, which are then individually protected. A team led by JJ Salazar of the University La Laguna Tenerife, Spain, has developed the optimisation routines. Additionally Jordi Castro, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, has developed a solution based on networks. Jordi Castro also developed the CTA solution. The controlled rounding procedure has been developed by JJ Salazar in a project sponsored by ONS. In order to enhance the usability $\tau$-Argus now also can handle SPSS-system files. Forusing $\tau$-Argus in combination with SAS, several reports have been produced during the ESSnet projects. These reports and also the SAS-tools are available from the CASC/ESSNet website.The audit routine was first developed by Karl Luhn of the University of Ilmenau and further developed by Destatis.

For solving these optimisation problems, $\tau$-Argus traditionally uses commercial LP-solvers. Traditionally we use Xpress as an LP-solver. This package is kindly made available for users of $\tau$-Argus in a special agreement between the $\tau$-Argus-team and FICO, the developers of Xpress. Alternatively $\tau$-Argus can also use the cplex-package. Users can choose either solver to link to $\tau$-Argus (provided, of course, they purchase a license for the solver chosen). However users already having a licence for one of these packages for other applications can use their current licence for $\tau$-Argus as well. Starting with this Open Source version also free and open solver(Soplex) can now be used to solve the optimisation models behind Cell Suppression, rounding and CTA.
