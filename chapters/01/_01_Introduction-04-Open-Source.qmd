## Open Source
In the open source world the responsibility for the software isdifferent. The idea behind open source is that the software code is nolonger owned by one institute (Statistics Netherlands), but the sourceis available for anybody. Anybody can also contribute to the code andmake his own extensions. Nevertheless we do not want to have manydifferent versions of the software and many diversions.
Therefore there will always be one official version of $\tau$-Argus. Inorder to achieve this we need a body to make decisions about furtherdevelopments and extensions for the official $\tau$-Argus. Thisresponsibility will be in the hands of a small committee. Thiscommittee will be a sub-group of the Eurostat technical working groupon Statistical Confidentiality. They will make decisions on whether anew extension/correction will be allowed in the official versions of$\tau$-Argus, and also make recommendations for future extensions.
Nevertheless the above mentioned email address([**argus@cbs.nl**](mailto:argus@cbs.nl)) will remain open forquestions.
