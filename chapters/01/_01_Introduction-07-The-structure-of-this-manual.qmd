## The structure of this manual

The remaining part of this manual consists of four chapters and an index.
In @sec-producingSafeTables we will give a short introduction to the theory and methodology. However for a more fundamental description we refer to the Wiley handbook on Statistical Disclosure Control[^4]. This handbook is the result of the joined work of the SDC specialists in Europe working together for a long period.
