# Description of the Menu Items {#sec-menu}

@sec-tour gave a brief introduction of the most frequently used options within $\tau$-Argus. In this section a more detailed description of the program by menu-item is presented. In @sec-further some general descriptions are given.

 Compared with the previous versions of $\tau$-Argus (before 4.0 and before the Open Source version) the main window of $\tau$-Argus looks rather different. A window with the unsafe combinations by variable and by code was presented. This information however was seldom used and the main focus of the users of $\tau$-Argus was on the table itself. So from version 4.0 onwards the main window of $\tau$-Argus will show the table(s) itself.
